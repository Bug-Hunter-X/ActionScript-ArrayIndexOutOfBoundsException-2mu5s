This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: attempting to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs because ActionScript arrays are zero-indexed, and the code attempts to access an element at index 2 when only indices 0 and 1 contain values.  The solution involves adding checks to ensure that the index is within the valid range of the array.
